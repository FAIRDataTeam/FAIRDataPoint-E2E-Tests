# FAIR Data Point E2E Tests

> E2E test suite for the [FAIR Data Point](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint), [FAIR Data Point Client](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint-client) and [Open Refine Metadata Extension](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/OpenRefine-metadata-extension) based on [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).


## Project Structure

- `/cypress`
    - Contains all test files following the standard [Cypress structure](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Support-file).
- `/fdp`
    - Contains the configuration to run FDP and other associated services in Docker.
    - The actual docker compose.yml file is generated during initialization.
- `/scripts`
    - Additional utility scripts.
- `/cypress.json`
    - Contains the default configuration and env.
    - You can overwrite env values [with a `cypress.env.json` file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables.html#Option-2-cypress-env-json).


## Environment Variables

When initializing the `compose.yml` file, the following ENV variables can be used to choose different images to test.

| Name | Example | Default |
